# Inspiration ✨

<strong>Millions of individuals throughout the world are unable to read or write, making them vulnerable to the exceedingly perplexing language of long legal paperwork. India has the world's highest adult illiteracy rate. According to the most recent UNESCO data, India has 287 million illiterate adults, accounting for 37% of the world's illiterate population.

Farmers, manual labourers, and individuals living in poverty lack access to education, and as a result, they are unable to comprehend legal words and, in many cases, the language of the documents, which are written in English. As a result, they are prone to financial debt. As a result, we present Saaraansh to you.</strong>

# What it does 🙌

Saaraansh is a simple online tool that summarises lengthy legal papers into easy-to-understand phrases and then converts them to the individual's native language so that he or she understands exactly what they are signing by simply uploading/taking a picture of the document.
The software works as follows:

- Users upload papers they wish to understand
- The app utilises an API to process the document
- Then provides a simplified and summarised document in their preferred regional language

This provides the user with a lot easier-to-read document with which they can grasp the document's larger provisions and decide whether or not to proceed with the agreements.

# How we built it 💡

1. The website's UI/UX was created with Figma and then built with Next.js a ReactJS Framework, and Tailwind CSS for the UI, Tensorflow.js, Python, and the Google Cloud Platform API to convert the summary to the regional language.
1. To develop the document summarizer utilising Natural Language Processing, the Hugging Face open-source framework has been used.
1. The OCR text recognition capability was implemented using OCR Tesseract.js.

# Novelty 🥇

There is no software available that can generate a summarising text for Legal Docs with translation capabilities. Two features have been added to the summary to convert the summary to regional languages and text to voice conversion for improved comprehension and usage, based on several research papers on legal document summaries.

# Future Aspects ✔

#### ➡ Improving the NLP Model to create the summary more precisely.

#### ➡ Create a mobile application for the same.

#### ➡ Adding more regional languages and adding text-to-speech for the summarized text.
